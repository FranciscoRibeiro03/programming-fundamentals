# This program finds the maximum of two numbers.
# It uses the built-in max function.
# Can you do it with a conditional statement (if / if-else) instead?

x1 = float(input("number? "))
x2 = float(input("number? "))

# Use a conditional statement instead of max function!
# mx = max(x1, x2)

mx = x1 if x1 > x2 else x2
